title: Are Enterprise IT systems fragile?
tags: [philosophy]
---
I am currently reading a book called [Antifragile - Things that gain from disorder](http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/1400067820) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
He makes some interesting points in his books about various systems but I believe a lot of what he says can be used in thoughts about enterprise IT systems.
